# RESULT for ABAP

Hi! "RESULT for ABAP" is - surprise, surprise - an ABAP implementation of the Result-Pattern. It's a way to solve a common problem: a method-call can be successful (OK) or it can fail (FAILURE) and the caller needs to know.  The Result-Pattern indicates if the operation was successful or failed without the usage of exceptions. It is a quite common pattern in functional languages.

## Why should I use RESULT for ABAP instead of exceptions?
* Exceptions are actually only for... well, exceptional cases, like DB errors, locks etc. not for "domain errors" like validations etc.
* Exception are often being used as a fancy form of the GOTO-statement. You often don't know where they will be caught. If they get caught at all.
* Exceptions lead to hard to read code for example when many different exceptions have to be caught.
* Exceptions sometimes are not really helpful, because people tend to wrap all code into a TRY...CATCH-block for CX_ROOT.
* Exceptions tend to return only one error, but what if you have multiple errors?
* Often command-methods just return a value like "it worked," which is either ABAP_TRUE or ABAP_FALSE. But no additional error values are available which could be shown in the frontend.
* Often query-methods just return the result of a query and when the result is empty, then this represents an error. But what was the reason for the error?
* Other methods export two values: the actual value and an optional error message. But now you can only use EXPORTING and not RETURNING, because there are two parameters. This leads to hard to read code. Ideally a method should only return one value.
* You could use a structure (value, error_message) to solve that problem. RESULT for ABAP is a comfortable object oriented way of doing this - a standardized solution. Your method simply returns a RESULT. ðŸ¦–
* RESULT enables a fluent coding style compared to try...catch...endtry all over the place.
* Consistently using RESULT as the name for the returning parameter of methods simplifies method definitions and significantly improves readability of your code

## Okay, show me an example
### Creating successful RESULTs
```abap
* create a RESULT which represents a success (OK)
result = zcl_result=>ok( ).
* another one with additional information, i.e. the key of an object you created or the object itself
result = zcl_result=>ok( 100040340 ).
* when a validator returns false
result = zcl_result=>fail_if( validator_returns_false( ) ).
* when a validator returns false + error message
result = zcl_result=>fail_if( this_is_true = validator_returns_false( ) error_message = 'a wild error occurred' ).
* when a validator returns true
result = zcl_result=>ok_if( validator_returns_true( ) ).
* when a validator returns true
result = zcl_result=>ok_if( this_is_true = validator_returns_true( ) error_message = 'a wild error occurred' ).
```
### Creating failures
```abap
* create a RESULT which indicates a FAILURE
result = zcl_result=>fail( ).
* with an error message
result = zcl_result=>fail('a wild error occurred').
* when a validator returns true
result = zcl_result=>fail_if( validator_returns_true( ) ).
* when a validator returns true + error message
result = zcl_result=>fail_if( this_is_true = validator_returns_true( ) error_message = 'a wild error occurred' ).
* when a validator returns false
result = zcl_result=>ok_if( validator_returns_false( ) ).
* when a validator returns false
result = zcl_result=>ok_if( this_is_true = validator_returns_false( ) error_message = 'a wild error occurred' ).
```
### Combining results
Usually there are many validations at the start of a method, so you might like to combine their single RESULTs into a final big one. The typical use case here is "validate X variables and all have to be OK, otherwise it's a FAILURE so stop processing the data". So if there is at least one FAILURE, the RESULT will be a FAILURE. Otherwise the RESULT will be OK. Currently only one error message will be stored. Combined OK-RESULTs don't have a value. You can also return a table of RESULTs from you method if you need the details.
```abap
* combined RESULT is OK
DATA(result_one) = zcl_result=>ok( ).
DATA(result_two) = zcl_result=>ok( ).
result = result_one->combine_with_one( result_two ).

* combined RESULT is a FAILURE
DATA results TYPE zcl_result=>ty_results.
DATA(result_one) = zcl_result=>ok( ).
DATA(result_two) = zcl_result=>fail( error_message ).
DATA(result_three) = zcl_result=>fail( error_message ).
results = VALUE #( ( result_two ) ( result_three ) ).
result = result_one->combine_with_multiple( results ).
```

### Adding Metadata to a RESULT
If you need more then just the one VALUE of an OK-RESULT, you can add metadata to the result. Metadata are key-value-pairs, with a unique CHAR30 key and the value being a data reference. Metadata can be added to any type of RESULT.
```abap
* Adding Metadata
DATA(structure) = VALUE zst_metadata_entry( key = 'a' value = REF #( 'random structure' ) ).
result = zcl_result=>ok( )->with_metadata( key = 'a structure' value = structure ).
result->with_metdata( key = 'band' value = 'Slayer' ).

* Reading metadata with a key
DATA(value) =  result->get_metadata( 'a structure' ).
* Reading the whole key-value-table
DATA(metadata) = result->get_all_metadata( ).
```

### Usage of a RESULT in a method
Use the RESULT as a RETURNING parameter:
```abap
METHOD do_something IMPORTING partner TYPE bu_partner
                    RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE REF TO zcl_result.
                    
...

METHOD do_something.
* 100s of lines of arcane logic

* hooray, no problems at all
result = zcl_result=>ok( 100040340 ).
ENDMETHOD.
```
### Processing a RESULT
Use the RESULT-object for flow control as you like:
```abap
* call a method which returns a result
DATA new_partner TYPE bu_partner.
DATA(result) = do_something( partner ).

* guarding
IF result->is_failure( ).
DATA(error_message) = result->get_error_message( ).
* log / error for webservice
EXIT.
ENDIF.

new_partner = result->get_value( )->*.
* do something with partner, i.e. persistence
```

## How to install RESULT for ABAP
You can copy and paste the source code into your system or simply clone this repository with [abapGit](https://abapgit.org/). 

## Test List
I like to create a simple [acceptance test list](https://agiledojo.de/2018-12-16-tdd-testlist/) before I start coding. It's my personal todo-list. Often the list is very domain-centric, this one is quite technical.

:white_check_mark: `GET_ERROR_MESSAGE` throws when OK-RESULT
:white_check_mark: when `WITH_ERROR_MESSAGE gets called with an empty message on a FAILURE, it just returns the current result
:white_check_mark: when `WITH_ERROR_MESSAGE( 'a wild error occurred' )` gets called on a FAILURE, the message will be added to the list of error messages and can be retrieved with `GET_ERROR_MESSAGES`
:white_check_mark: when `WITH_ERROR_MESSAGE( 'a wild error occurred' )` gets called on a OK-RESULT it doesnt do anything but return the result
:black_square_button: update the docs :japanese_ogre:

As you can see I'm commiting after every test. I also often use the Â´zero, one, multipleÂ´ or the Â´happy path, unhappy pathÂ´ patterns to write my tests to drive my logic.
